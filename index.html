            I have always enjoyed working with technology, ever since I was able to play aroung in a PC I wanted to figure out what every setting was for and customize my experience to every extent I could. Since then I have become more and more proficient at working with both software and hardware and have become an &quot;honorary IT guy&quot; for both my family and friends, as well as colleagues at work. My experience with coding for Web Development has only encouraged me to keep learning more about this subject and hope to keep finding exciting new ways to use these new skills.
